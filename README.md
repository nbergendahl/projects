# projects

This GitHub repository is intended to be used to showcase my software projects to employers.

The Capstone folder holds my capstone project I developed for my Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology, as a final capstone project. It is a remote computer management script that can be used manage computers within an internal network, or through a VPN. There are still a few bugs, but it was a great way to learn how to create a useful business solution using PowerShell.
