priv.sh is a quick privilege escalation enumeration script that uses commands I found myself frequently using
in capture the flag events for Linux privilege escalation.

Use:

1. Download priv.sh or copy into a text editor directly.
2. Move to the target Linux endpoint to allow running the file locally on the target.
3. Ensure the file is executeable by using: chmod +x priv.sh 
4. You can run the program like any other bash script: ./priv.sh
